                <h2>What is BMI?</h2>
                <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value of a person's weight in relation to their height. It is a
                    simple tool that helps to categorize individuals into different weight categories, such as
                    underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese.</p>
                <p>The formula to calculate BMI is: BMI = (weight in kilograms) / (height in meters)^2</p>
                <p>BMI provides a rough estimate of body fat and is often used as a screening tool for potential health
                    risks associated with being underweight or overweight.</p>
